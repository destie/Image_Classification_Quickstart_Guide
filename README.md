# Image_Classification_Quickstart_Guide
Quick walkthrough of how to set up a classification model in tensorflow. 

The following guide is intended for students in the Loew lab (And others who find this useful) to be able to quickly put together a model. This hopefully provides a useful framework and explanation for why things are the way they are in this model. 


**Creating_Training_and_Testing_Datasets**
This creates a training and testing set from one directory

**Model_Compilation_and_Training**
This builds your directory

**Validation**
This takes your model file and validates it on a new holdout/ validation set (or single image)
